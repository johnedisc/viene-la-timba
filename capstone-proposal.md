Name of Student: Chris Johnedis

Name of Project: viene-la-timba

Project's Purpose or Goal: project will alert users when a cuban music event is coming within a certain radius of the user.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* user enters a zip code and get a list back of upcoming events
* needs a simple landing page that will make an api call

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* get a domain name
* spin a virtual computer on aws EC2
* node.js server without frameworks to serve user data from db
* jest to test backend functionality
* database (probably MySql)
* deciding on vannilla js or react for the client
* API calls to TicketMaster for concert info as a base
* minimalist styling from scratch with css

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* user authentication
* email/text notifications for concert updates (have to learn about what apis offer that service)
* deploy with github actions

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* learn about json web tokens from authentication from server and store in client state
* learn about deployment scripts writing yaml to make a pipeline

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

* it is important to me on this project that I learn some of the nuts and bolts of the web. with c#, i basically feel very very distant from what is actually going on with the web. i also just think that c# feels awkward, and am opting from typescript instead.
* i therefore am minimizing the use of frameworks where possible. and probably going to use vanilla js. i am on the fence about that on account of its prevalence in job postings.
* thanks for reading!
