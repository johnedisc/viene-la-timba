# 'viene la timba' notes

## updates
* the process of finding a suitable api is not going well, so I am switching to making up some fake data for the moment to not have to switch ideas mid-process
* still learning about node.js.
* still need to: set up database and find a way to send email notifications
* after that: sign in and jwt from server

### i want to do the following:
* get a domain name
* spin up a aws machine. [techLead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YXqXPWjmKk)
* build a simple node js server [dave gray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZAKY-CDKog) [start with his intro to node](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PFkIxaJ6Xx_X46avTM1aYw)
* authenticate [user](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4/token_authentication)
* set up a database on that virtual machine (mysql or [mongo](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/saving_data_to_mongo_db)
* hook a typescript front end up to it (react or [vanilla js](https://dev.to/vijaypushkin/dead-simple-state-management-in-vanilla-javascript-24p0)?)
* make api calls from that front end
* use vite and yarn?
* testing?
* space background? [generated with js?](https://www.siteinspire.com/websites/6430-clement-brichon)
* all of this makes me want to learn about nuts and bolts of http/tcp and build a server with a low-level language like [c](https://bruinsslot.jp/post/simple-http-webserver-in-c/)
